Feature: Update Artists OS status

As an administrator, I can edit an artist's info

Background:
  Given there are artists with art in the system
  And there are future open studios events
  And an "admin" account has been created
  And I login
  When I click on "artists" in the admin menu
  And I click on the first artist edit button that's not me

  And I click on "Update Artist"
  And I see the admin artist show page with updated values:
