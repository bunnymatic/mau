With influences as diverse as Rousseau and John Cage, new tensions are distilled from both explicit and implicit layers. Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the moment. What starts out as hope soon becomes debased into a tragedy of temptation, leaving only a sense of dread and the unlikelihood of a new understanding. As wavering replicas become transformed through studious and academic practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the inaccuracies of our future.",
