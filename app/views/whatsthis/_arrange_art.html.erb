This page allows you to control the order of your pieces when they are shown on your profile page and in the thumbnail browser for an individual art piece.  It is also used to figure out your representative image: the picture we use when showing you in the list of all artists or in a search result.  The picture that is first in the set (top left) will be the one we use as your representative.
