      Q: share my page with others?
    </div>
    <div class="faq_a">
      A: 2 ways : Look for "Share this page" on your profile for Twitter and Facebook links.  Or use your custom MAU webpage everywhere!<br/>
      <% if logged_in? && current_user[:type] == 'Artist'
         nm = current_user.login
         else
         nm = "&lt;your username&gt;".html_safe
         end
         -%>

      Q: sign up?
    </div>
    <div class="faq_a">
      A: If you're having problems with the registration form, try a username that doesn't have any spaces or special characters.  If you haven't received your activation email, make sure to check your spam folder.  If you've tried all of these and still can't get stuff to work, please let us know (<span class="mau-note-link help-me">email us</span>).

      Q: can i receive inquiries from website visitors while keeping my email address private?
    </div>
    <div class="faq_a">
      A: Nope! We had a problem with Art scammers combing the site and hitting everyone up so we've disabled this feature.  You can send notes (without sharing emails directly) to other artists on the site.
