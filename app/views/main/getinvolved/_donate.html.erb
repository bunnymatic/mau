<p/>
Because we are a small group and working on volunteer resources, expenses come out of our pockets.  Our events cost money and if you would like, we'd love to take your $$$ to support our efforts.  
<p/>
We do not have 501(3)c status, so your donations are currently not tax-deductible, but you can donate with the knowledge that your donations are very appreciated and would help us in our efforts to support and promote the artists in the Mission.
<p/>
Use this button to donate to our group via PayPal.  And we'll love you forever.
