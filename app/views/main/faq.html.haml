          A: If you're having problems with the registration form, try a username that doesn't have any spaces or special characters.  If you haven't received your activation email, make sure to check your spam folder.  If you've tried all of these and still can't get stuff to work, please let us know

          Q: can i receive inquiries from website visitors while keeping my email address private?
        %p.faq__a
          A: Nope! We had a problem with Art scammers combing the site and hitting everyone up so we've disabled this feature.  If you need to communciate with an artist, check out their profile.  You may find they have a website or a facebook page and you can try contacting them through those channels.
