  %h4 What is Open Studios?
  %p
    Twice a year, hundreds of artists in Mission open their studio doors to the public for a whole weekend.
    It's a fun, FREE EVENT where art lovers meander about this creative eclectic neighborhood we all love
    and see an intimate views of the artists in their workspaces. For both events, Mission Artists United
    provides a map and a catalog of artists with their artwork to help you plan your meanderings.
