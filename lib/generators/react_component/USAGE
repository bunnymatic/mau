Description:
    Creates a React component file and test file in the app/webpack/reactjs/components directory.

Example:
    bin/rails generate react_component Thing

    This will create:
         app/webpack/reactjs/components/thing.tsx
         app/webpack/reactjs/components/thing.test.tsx

    You must add it manually to the `react/components/index.ts` if you need it
    to be automounted from a `.slim` file.  If it is only used within other
    React components, it doesn't need to be registered there because it can
    be included with webpack `imports`.
